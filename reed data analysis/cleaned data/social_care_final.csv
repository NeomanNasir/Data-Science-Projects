We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because  wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com Overview of the independent end-point assessor role Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure  that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices,  following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with. An independent EPA means that those making a decision on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake  end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element, and must not have been involved  in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices. The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality  assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives. IEAs will meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided  by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details. Key Accountabilities: The IEA will: · Take part in regular training and standardisation activities, associated with the role of IEA for this EPA · Maintain and provide evidence of ongoing, relevant Continuous Professional Development (CPD) · Assess the performance of candidates in accordance with published assessment and grading criteria and procedures, ensuring overall standards are maintained · Follow the protocols set out in Pearson’s specifications, assessment materials and quality assurance protocols, relating to the EPAs · Maintain service-level agreements with regards to responding to EPA planning, operational activities, reports and submissions of assessment outcomes · Report all risks and issues encountered during the end-point assessment to Pearson, including any suspected malpractice/maladministration · Ensure all EPA reports and assessment evidence are high quality and recorded accurately · Support Pearson, if necessary, with any appeals from apprentices, regarding assessment decisions · Allow additional time for travel, when making EPA arrangements · Raise any conflicts of interest, including in relation to the independence of assessment · Ensure that any personal actions are completed, as required by Pearson · Contribute to the continuous improvement of Pearson’s end-point assessment activities · Contribute to the external quality assurance activities undertaken by Ofqual. Person Specification Occupational Profile: Senior Healthcare Support Workers (SHCSW) help registered practitioners deliver healthcare services to people.

We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because  wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com Overview of the independent end-point assessor role Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure  that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices,  following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with. An independent EPA means that those making a decision on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake  end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element, and must not have been involved  in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices. The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality  assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives. IEAs will meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided  by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details Key Accountabilities: The IEA will: · Take part in regular training and standardisation activities, associated with the role of IEA for this EPA · Maintain and provide evidence of ongoing, relevant Continuous Professional Development (CPD) · Assess the performance of candidates in accordance with published assessment and grading criteria and procedures, ensuring overall standards are maintained · Follow the protocols set out in Pearson’s specifications, assessment materials and quality assurance protocols, relating to the EPAs · Maintain service-level agreements with regards to responding to EPA planning, operational activities, reports and submissions of assessment outcomes · Report all risks and issues encountered during the end-point assessment to Pearson, including any suspected malpractice/maladministration · Ensure all EPA reports and assessment evidence are high quality and recorded accurately · Support Pearson, if necessary, with any appeals from apprentices, regarding assessment decisions · Allow additional time for travel, when making EPA arrangements · Raise any conflicts of interest, including in relation to the independence of assessment · Ensure that any personal actions are completed, as required by Pearson · Contribute to the continuous improvement of Pearson’s end-point assessment activities · Contribute to the external quality assurance activities undertaken by Ofqual. Person Specification Occupational Profile: Senior Healthcare Support Workers (SHCSW) help registered practitioners deliver healthcare services to people. As an experienced support worker, they carry out a range of clinical and non-clinical healthcare or therapeutic tasks, under the direct or indirect  supervision of the registered healthcare practitioner. SHCSWs provide high quality, compassionate healthcare, following standards, policies or protocols and always acting within the limits of their competence. SHCSWs may work in a range of services e.g. hospital,  community, health or day case unit, birth centre or midwifery led unit, someone’s home, operating theatre, nursing or care home, assessment centre, hospice, school, prison, GP surgery, charity or voluntary organisation; working in partnership with individuals,  families, carers and other service providers. Duties are delegated to the SHCSW in line with care plans. Not all duties are routine and the SHCSW will need to use their knowledge, experience and understanding to take decisions within their area of responsibility. A SHCSW is accountable for their work  and for reviewing the effectiveness of their actions. The role is undertaken following a period of experience in healthcare so they are able to demonstrate best practice and act as a role model.

We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because  wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com Overview of the independent end-point assessor role Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure  that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices,  following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with. An independent EPA means that those making a decision on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake  end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element, and must not have been involved  in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices. The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality  assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives. IEAs will meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided  by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details. Key Accountabilities: The IEA will: · Take part in regular training and standardisation activities, associated with the role of IEA for this EPA · Maintain and provide evidence of ongoing, relevant Continuous Professional Development (CPD) · Assess the performance of candidates in accordance with published assessment and grading criteria and procedures, ensuring overall standards are maintained · Follow the protocols set out in Pearson’s specifications, assessment materials and quality assurance protocols, relating to the EPAs · Maintain service-level agreements with regards to responding to EPA planning, operational activities, reports and submissions of assessment outcomes · Report all risks and issues encountered during the end-point assessment to Pearson, including any suspected malpractice/maladministration · Ensure all EPA reports and assessment evidence are high quality and recorded accurately · Support Pearson, if necessary, with any appeals from apprentices, regarding assessment decisions · Allow additional time for travel, when making EPA arrangements · Raise any conflicts of interest, including in relation to the independence of assessment · Ensure that any personal actions are completed, as required by Pearson · Contribute to the continuous improvement of Pearson’s end-point assessment activities · Contribute to the external quality assurance activities undertaken by Ofqual. Person Specification Occupational Profile: Senior Healthcare Support Workers (SHCSW) help registered practitioners deliver healthcare services to people. As an experienced support worker, they carry out a range of clinical and non-clinical healthcare or therapeutic tasks, under the direct or indirect  supervision of the registered healthcare practitioner. SHCSWs provide high quality, compassionate healthcare, following standards, policies or protocols and always acting within the limits of their competence. SHCSWs may work in a range of services e.g. hospital,  community, health or day case unit, birth centre or midwifery led unit, someone’s home, operating theatre, nursing or care home, assessment centre, hospice, school, prison, GP surgery, charity or voluntary organisation; working in partnership with individuals,  families, carers and other service providers. Duties are delegated to the SHCSW in line with care plans. Not all duties are routine and the SHCSW will need to use their knowledge, experience and understanding to take decisions within their area of responsibility. A SHCSW is accountable for their work  and for reviewing the effectiveness of their actions. The role is undertaken following a period of experience in healthcare so they are able to demonstrate best practice and act as a role model. A SHCSW may supervise or guide the less experienced staff in  their team. SHCSWs follow the Code of Conduct for Healthcare Support Workers and Adult Social Care Workers. Mental Health Support Mental Health Support Workers support individuals with mental ill health. They work as part of a multi-disciplinary team offering a range of mental health services. Mental Health Support Workers will support individuals, and their families, at different  stages of their illness or recovery by listening, providing emotional support, developing and reviewing plans to meet their needs; observing and reporting changes in their mental and physical well-being; encouraging independence and enabling them to manage  their condition and quality of life. Usually, a Mental Health Support Worker will have to work closely with carers and with other organisations e.g. housing or social care.

We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because  wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com Overview of the independent end-point assessor role Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure  that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices,  following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with. An independent EPA means that those making a decision on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake  end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element, and must not have been involved  in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices. The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality  assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives. IEAs will meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided  by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details. Key Accountabilities: The IEA will: · Take part in regular training and standardisation activities, associated with the role of IEA for this EPA · Maintain and provide evidence of ongoing, relevant Continuous Professional Development (CPD) · Assess the performance of candidates in accordance with published assessment and grading criteria and procedures, ensuring overall standards are maintained · Follow the protocols set out in Pearson’s specifications, assessment materials and quality assurance protocols, relating to the EPAs · Maintain service-level agreements with regards to responding to EPA planning, operational activities, reports and submissions of assessment outcomes · Report all risks and issues encountered during the end-point assessment to Pearson, including any suspected malpractice/maladministration · Ensure all EPA reports and assessment evidence are high quality and recorded accurately · Support Pearson, if necessary, with any appeals from apprentices, regarding assessment decisions · Allow additional time for travel, when making EPA arrangements · Raise any conflicts of interest, including in relation to the independence of assessment · Ensure that any personal actions are completed, as required by Pearson · Contribute to the continuous improvement of Pearson’s end-point assessment activities · Contribute to the external quality assurance activities undertaken by Ofqual.

We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because  wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com Overview of the independent end-point assessor role Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure  that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices,  following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with. An independent EPA means that those making a decision on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake  end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element, and must not have been involved  in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices. The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions. EPA activities will be quality  assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives. IEAs will meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship assessment plan, and the materials provided  by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details. Key Accountabilities: The IEA will: · Take part in regular training and standardisation activities, associated with the role of IEA for this EPA · Maintain and provide evidence of ongoing, relevant Continuous Professional Development (CPD) · Assess the performance of candidates in accordance with published assessment and grading criteria and procedures, ensuring overall standards are maintained · Follow the protocols set out in Pearson’s specifications, assessment materials and quality assurance protocols, relating to the EPAs · Maintain service-level agreements with regards to responding to EPA planning, operational activities, reports and submissions of assessment outcomes · Report all risks and issues encountered during the end-point assessment to Pearson, including any suspected malpractice/maladministration · Ensure all EPA reports and assessment evidence are high quality and recorded accurately · Support Pearson, if necessary, with any appeals from apprentices, regarding assessment decisions · Allow additional time for travel, when making EPA arrangements · Raise any conflicts of interest, including in relation to the independence of assessment · Ensure that any personal actions are completed, as required by Pearson · Contribute to the continuous improvement of Pearson’s end-point assessment activities · Contribute to the external quality assurance activities undertaken by Ofqual.

Not all duties are routine and the SHCSW will need to use their knowledge, experience and understanding to take decisions within their area of responsibility. A SHCSW is accountable for their work  and for reviewing the effectiveness of their actions. The role is undertaken following a period of experience in healthcare so they are able to demonstrate best practice and act as a role model. A SHCSW may supervise or guide the less experienced staff in  their team. SHCSWs follow the Code of Conduct for Healthcare Support Workers and Adult Social Care Workers. Adult Nursing Support Senior adult nursing support workers look after adults in a range of settings, duties will vary accordingly. In most instances their supervisor will be a registered nurse. Some people the senior adult nursing support worker supports will have short term  needs: e.g. they have sustained an injury. Others may have long-term conditions which affect them every day, all their lives e.g. asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, dementia, depression, stroke or arthritis. Many people suffer from more than one condition  e.g. an older person who has sustained a fall and has a wound that needs regular dressing, may also have heart disease. Some people will need round the clock care, being able to do very little for themselves, requiring the senior adult nursing support worker  to look after all their personal needs including feeding, washing, going to the toilet as well as carrying out clinical tasks like checking their blood pressure or pulse.

We hold a large number of contracts with the NHS and have an ever-expanding portfolio  of work, making us the largest independent Care Coordinator in the UK. Since 1995 we have built a reputation as a trusted patient focused service specialising in assisting with hospital discharges to suitable care homes or sourcing care packages for clients  leaving hospital, whilst supporting families in the process. We are looking to engage self-employed advisers to assist Next of Kin (NOK) / families in their search for a care home or package of care for their relative in the Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch areas. Core Duties and Responsibilities: The main function of an adviser is to provide support to family / NOK needing to find a care home or package of care for a relative, friend or loved one who is in hospital. The adviser will guide and support family / NOK throughout this process. You will liaise with patients or their NOK / families as directed by your Coordinator. You will present details of the CHS service, confirm the needs of the patient, identify appropriate homes / care agencies and then accompany family / NOK on visits. You will then liaise between the family / NOK, the home of choice / care agency and your Coordinator in order to ensure a prompt and appropriate discharge. You will be working within a small team, including other advisers and at all times you will be directed and supported by your Coordinator who will be managing all of the necessary liaising with health professionals and in appropriate cases with social care. A healthcare background is an advantage; however, your interpersonal skills are more important to this role, which is based on organisation, liaison and communication. You need a calm and adaptable approach to deal with potentially difficult situations -  we support family / NOK during what can be a stressful and upsetting time. What sort of person are we looking for? Some of our advisers have a background in health and social care, having held roles which include nursing, social work and care home management/owners. However, a health and social care background is not essential. We have employed police officers, pure  administrators, office managers, lawyers, estate agents and sales executives. Your interpersonal skills are the primary consideration, as the role involves meeting families, often at a time of great stress, and working with them in a sensitive and effective  way. You must be outgoing, empathetic and with a genuine desire to build long term supportive and friendly relationships with colleagues and clients. You will need to be highly organised and reliable. There is an administrative component to this work and you will need to enjoy keeping on top of the details with excellent PC/IT skills. Hours of work can be flexible and depend upon the amount of work currently referred to us; however, we are unable to guarantee any set number of hours. In order to meet the needs of the NOK / families we work with, some evening and weekend  work is necessary.Although you will be self-employed, we will be finding all of the work for you and there is no expectation that you should do this. You must have your own computer and ideally an iPad tablet for displaying portfolios to families. You will be expected to accompany families on visits to homes and therefore will ideally need the use of a 4-seater car. A scanner for scanning documents into our database or a printer/scanner capable of doing the same would be an advantage. This is an ideal opportunity for part-time, flexible work covering the Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch areas. Many of our employees are of graduate calibre, most with 5 GCSE’s at A-C level and above. Remuneration is based on a two-stage fee - one for the initial appointment and one for successfully finding an appropriate placement; fee levels will be confirmed during interview.

We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because  wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com Overview of the independent end-point assessor role Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure  that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices,  following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with. An independent EPA means that those making a decision on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake  end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element, and must not have been involved  in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices. The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers and/or providers if appropriate. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions.  EPA activities will be quality assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives. IEAs for these EPAs will be qualified IQAs that meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship  assessment plan, and the materials provided by Pearson.

We put the apprentice at the centre of everything we do, because  wherever learning flourishes, so do people. Find out more about how we can help you and your learners at qualifications.pearson.com Overview of the independent end-point assessor role Government has introduced a requirement that all apprenticeships contain an end-point assessment (EPA) which is a holistic assessment of the Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs) that have been learnt throughout the apprenticeship. This is to make sure  that apprentices meet the rigorous standard set by employers and are fully competent in the relevant occupation. Pearson must provide employers with the confidence that completing an apprenticeship means an individual is fully job-ready and that all apprentices,  following the same standard, are assessed consistently, regardless of where they are undertaking their apprenticeship or who they are doing it with. An independent EPA means that those making a decision on the competency of the apprentice have nothing to gain from the outcome of the assessment. To maintain independence within the scope of this EPA, an independent end-point assessor (IEA) can only undertake  end-point assessments of apprentices, with whom they have no conflict of interest. This means they must be independent of the registered apprenticeship training provider at which the apprentice completed their on-programme element, and must not have been involved  in the on-programme training, assessment, or line management of such apprentices. The end-point assessments will be conducted onsite, or remotely, on dates agreed with employers and/or providers if appropriate. Independent end-point assessors will record and submit the EPA outcomes, with clear justifications for the grading decisions.  EPA activities will be quality assured by Pearson quality assurance representatives. IEAs for these EPAs will be qualified IQAs that meet the occupational profile of the apprentices they are assessing and will be trained, standardised and approved to operate as IEAs. The IEAs will undertake EPAs in line with the associated apprenticeship  assessment plan, and the materials provided by Pearson. Please see the below Key Accountabilities and Person Specification sections for further details. Key Accountabilities: · The independent end-point assessor will: · Take part in regular training and standardisation activities, associated with the role of independent end-point assessor for this EPA · Maintain and provide evidence of ongoing, relevant Continuous Professional Development (CPD) · Assess the performance of candidates in accordance with published assessment and grading criteria and procedures, ensuring overall standards are maintained · Follow the protocols set out in Pearson’s specifications, assessment materials and quality assurance protocols, relating to the EPAs · Maintain service-level agreements with regards to responding to EPA planning, operational activities, reports and submissions of assessment outcomes · Report all risks and issues encountered during the end-point assessment to Pearson, including any suspected malpractice/maladministration · Ensure all EPA reports and assessment evidence are high quality and recorded accurately · Support Pearson, if necessary, with any appeals from apprentices, regarding assessment decisions · Allow additional time for travel, when making EPA arrangements · Raise any conflicts of interest, including in relation to the independence of assessment · Ensure that any personal actions are completed, as required by Pearson · Contribute to the continuous improvement of Pearson’s end-point assessment activities · Contribute to the external quality assurance activities undertaken by the Adult Social Care External Quality Assurance Service (ACEQUAS) which is managed by Skills for Care Person Specification Occupational Profiles: Adult Care Worker To work in care is to make a positive difference to someone’s life when they are faced with physical, practical, social, emotional or intellectual challenges.
