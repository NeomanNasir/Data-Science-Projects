And that’s before you even get to the interview. Because, as in any job, you’ll struggle to make it if you don’t have training or experience. Even if you know you’ve got the right personal attributes. Because you know it’s what you want, you know you have the raw materials and you can see the potential rewards, you decide to give it a go.And if you've got sales experience without the drinks bit or drinks experience without the sales bit, we'll help you make the most of your existing knowledge and transferable skills. Because we love ‘untapped’ potential. That’s why we created the unique ‘Field Sales Accelerator’ programme. After successfully completing a day at the assessment centre, you will be ready to be put forward for jobs all over the country. And for once the hiring managers won’t be put off by your lack of experience as they know that you haven’t necessarily come from  a field sales background. Once you’ve secured a job, you can then take advantage of the ‘Field Sales Accelerator’.Over 6 months, you’ll go through structured training, coaching and mentoring programme. All funded by brilliant clients, who are investing in you.Here, you’ll learn from specialists in the drinks sector. People who’ve ‘been there’ and ‘done that’, working their way up from junior field sales roles to Director level, and covering patches all over the world.You’ll learn every step in the sales process - from finding potential customers and asking the right questions to establish needs, then managing prospects through the entire sales cycle, through to ultimately winning new business and increasing existing customer  spend.That means, by the end of the programme, you’ll be a trained and experienced Field Sales rep. So, apply now by clicking apply and uploading a copy of your CV.Everyone will get a response. Spaces are limited and going fast. The job title of ‘Junior’ relates simply to the level of experience and has no relevance to age.
